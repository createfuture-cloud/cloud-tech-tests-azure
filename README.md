is updated in the [cloud-tech-tests](https://github.com/createfuture-cloud/cloud-tech-tests) repository, it will also create a zip of the code, this should be uploaded to the [paired programming exercise page](https://xsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TA/pages/3130621954/Paired+Programming+Interview+Template+Cloud+Engineer+-+Azure+Mid+Senior) on confluence

### Steps
